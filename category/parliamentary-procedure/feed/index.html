<em>Erskine May (Practical Treatise on the Law, Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament) </em><br />
<em>Riddick’s Rules of Procedure, </em><br />
<em>Argumentation and Debate, </em></p>
<p>I pride myself on having a wide array of references for parliamentary procedure as my philosophy follows that similar to the reason the rules exist: rules are there to facilitate and protect rights of individuals in a deliberative environment. The responsibility of a parliamentarian is to be an unbiased resource to ensure that we ensure that everyone has equal access to the same rules that guide debate so that it is a fair environment. With such, I also find myself being more relaxed on minute details on the method in which meetings are run, as often they are arbitrary and if they are accidentally forgotten, it would only <em>hinder </em>the meeting if I were to bring up a correction to the method in which the meeting is being run.</p>
<p>In terms of easiest to comprehend, I would encourage everyone to pick up a copy of <em>The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure</em> as it is one of the more modern interpretations of parliamentary procedure. It is more difficult to get your hands on even more current interpretations, but I also recommend <em>Meeting Procedures</em> and <em>Modern Parliamentary Procedure</em>. Most people are familiar with Robert&#8217;s Rules of Order, Newly Revised but fail to recognize that it is not the only way to learn the basics of parliamentary procedure and actually I feel like <em><strong>fails</strong> </em>some of the goals of parliamentary procedure by continuing to be inaccessible in terms of the language and the difficulty in interpretation because of the archaic language it uses.</p>
