            <p><strong>General Thoughts:</strong></p>
<p>I recognize that I don&rsquo;t like to be a public figure, but I also have duties to inform and to connect with constituents. I also have found it my goal to ensure everyone is educated about the process, so that any issues can be brought up to Senate and we can work to provide the best avenue for student voice to make lasting change on campus. &nbsp;With these goals in mind, I have decided to provide more information and insight into the behemoth that is Purdue Student Government.</p>
<p>So far, I have been disappointed in my fellow Senators, as they often bring up legislation without consulting or working with other Senators to ensure that they have the information required to bring a Bill or Resolution to a vote. Almost all of Senate was elected in a no-contest race, and so many Senators also forget to speak to the students they are representing to ensure that the students are actually advocates for some of these changes. Although the phrase &ldquo;I support this bill&rdquo; does not change, the context in which it is said impacts the way in which the Senator views their voice in Senate. I think that my voice in Senate should not be the voice of my own, but the voice of my peers amplified through my position. So when I say &ldquo;I support this bill&rdquo;, I do my best to consider the representation I am giving my constituents.</p>
<p>Regarding debate, I think we find ourselves finding our &ldquo;parties&rdquo; and not engaging in a lively debate. There is a lot of agreement in the form of &ldquo;I agree with Senator XXX, and I will be voting XXX&rdquo; which does not further debate and can be demonstrated in the final vote for the bill. Your support should be implicit not explicit to allow more time for debate and to ensure a timely meeting.</p>
<p>I find myself skeptical of the political power Senate can hold when we are still growing into a cohesive legislative body, and continue to have issues regarding communication, preparedness and lack of understanding of general meeting procedures and governing documents. As one of the architects of a massive rewrite of the governing documents last spring under my time as Parliamentarian, I found that most Senators had not read them in entirety and work to cherry pick their ideas from existing text, ignoring clarifications and overarching goals to pursue their own narrow minded vision of how things should be. &nbsp;Unfortunately this issue exists in the United States Government as well, but through continual education we can hope to reach at least a mutual understanding of how Purdue Student Government is supposed to work and operate.</p>
<p>Of course, all of these issues are held by myself and I encourage you to debate and engage me on these ideas, as I certainly hold no authority over opinions regarding the interpretation and method in which Purdue Student Government should operate and how it currently operates.</p>
<p><strong>Voting Record:</strong></p>
<p>Bill 15-42 : &ldquo;Academic Colleges Senate Representation Amendments to the PSG Constitution.&rdquo; (Amended bill incoming)</p>
<p>This bill intitally would have granted all academic colleges representation of 3 Senators, including the Honors College and Veterinary Medicine. In the first reading, we amended to remove references to the Honors College, as despite it being an academic college, we wish to ensure that every student has equal representation on Senate. One of the main arguments is that the voice or perspective was not being heard from the Honors College, which may in fact be true, but Senate seats are there for equal representation of students but not student voice. I had previously talked to Senators about only granting seats to &ldquo;academic degree-track colleges&rdquo; which excludes Honors College but would allow us to simplify our Governing Documents, which is a goal of mine. In the end,&nbsp;I voted to postpone until the meeting on December 2nd, so that any issues can be resolved prior to making this amendment to our Governing Documents as there were still unanswered questions about the wording and the seats that we would be granting to Veterinary Medicine.</p>
<p><a href="https://teter.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Resolution-15-21_Property-Tax-Incentive-for-Business-Growth.docx">Resolution 15-21 :_&rdquo;Property Tax Incentive for Business Growth&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;(Resolution number incorrect, will be fixed when Senate minutes are published)</p>
<p>I voted to postpone until the meeting on December 2nd, so that Aseem Jha can work out more details on the impact of the tax on the local government. I however am not sure that Purdue Student Government should be recommending&nbsp;modifications of property taxes when our goal and focus is to represent the student voice. Aseem Jha is the voice of the students on the West Lafayette City Council, and I think that he should be the advocate behind this proposal, not another governmental body that has no authority or expertise on the matter.</p>
<p><a href="https://teter.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Bill-15-44_PSG-Co-sponsorship-of-Multi-day-Tango-Festival.docx">Bill 15-44 : &ldquo;PSG Co-sponsorship of Multi-day Tango Festival&rdquo;</a></p>
<p>I voted in favor, as I think we should continue to encourage cultural development and the presenter for the club provided more than adequate evidence of cultural significance and education.</p>
<p><a href="https://teter.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Resolution-15-17_Support-for-University-Senate-Diversity-and-Equity-Committee-Stance-on-Faculty-Diversification.docx">Resolution 15-17_: &ldquo;Support for University Senate Diversity and Equity Committee Stance on Faculty Diversification&rdquo;</a></p>
<p>I voted in favor of this Resolution, as consideration of Diversity in terms of hiring those who are accepting and encourage the development of different ideas and acceptance of all methods of thought. (I may have worded improperly, but I hope that my simplification did it justice to some degree.)</p>
<p><a href="https://teter.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Resolution-15-18_Sales-Tax-Exemption-for-College-Textbooks.docx">Resolution 15-18 :_&rdquo;Sales Tax Exemption for College Textbooks&rdquo;</a></p>
<p>One of my peers, Senator Malloy&nbsp;brought up a point during debate that I would like to address. He stated that since we had moved to postpone Resolution 15-21 because of unfamiliarity and lack of clarity of the tax plan, that we should treat this bill the same. However, I see this as a false equivalence and it is an oversimplification of the issues at hand. Sales Tax Exemption for Textbooks&nbsp;<em>already&nbsp;</em>exists in the state of Indiana but does not include college-level textbooks. Our proposal also impacts all Purdue students directly and does not propose a drastic change in policy for our local government.</p>
<p>I voted in favor, as I believe students pay enough for school without taxation being an extra burden. Although not discussed in this bill, I hope that we can eventually have a discussion on why we need to purchase our textbooks when we pay incredibly high prices to attend Purdue, and work to find solutions that either allow for our tuition to pay for all of our textbooks or to eliminate the need to purchase textbooks.</p>
<p><a href="https://teter.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Resolution-15-20_Investigating-Mental-Health-Needs-and-Solutions.docx">Resolution 15-20&nbsp;: &ldquo;Investigating Mental Health Needs and Solutions&rdquo;</a></p>
<p>I voted in favor, despite disagreeing with sending this recommendation prior to a larger request to solve the issue (which is in the works, but a few months away). I did not speak about the issue, as it would have only hindered conversation and would not have made an impact on the final vote, as the recommendation still carries weight and lays groundwork for future resolutions.</p>

<p>I pride myself on having a wide array of references for parliamentary procedure as my philosophy follows that similar to the reason the rules exist: rules are there to facilitate and protect rights of individuals in a deliberative environment. The responsibility of a parliamentarian is to be an unbiased resource to ensure that we ensure that everyone has equal access to the same rules that guide debate so that it is a fair environment. With such, I also find myself being more relaxed on minute details on the method in which meetings are run, as often they are arbitrary and if they are accidentally forgotten, it would only&nbsp;<em>hinder&nbsp;</em>the meeting if I were to bring up a correction to the method in which the meeting is being run.</p>
<p>In terms of easiest to comprehend, I would encourage everyone to pick up a copy of <em>The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure</em> as it is one of the more modern interpretations of parliamentary procedure. It is more difficult to get your hands on even more current interpretations, but I also recommend <em>Meeting Procedures</em> and <em>Modern Parliamentary Procedure</em>. Most people are familiar with Robert&rsquo;s Rules of Order, Newly Revised but fail to recognize that it is not the only way to learn the basics of parliamentary procedure and actually I feel like&nbsp;<em><strong>fails</strong>&nbsp;</em>some of the goals of parliamentary procedure by continuing to be inaccessible in terms of the language and the difficulty in interpretation because of the archaic language it uses.</p>
